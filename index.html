      <p>
        Hi! I'm Brandon, a sophomore at RIT majoring in cybersecurity. I'm active in RIT's main cybersecurity club, where I participate 
        in Physical Vulnerability, Vulnerability Research, and Incident Response groups. I also play for the men's ultimate frisbee B team where I'm 
        treasurer and am involved in the car club. I regularly compete in cybersecurity competitions—most recently, I placed 10th out of about 
        2,100 participants in the DoD Cyber Sentinel for June 2025 and won $500 USD. I write up some of my competition challenges, 
        which you can read <a href="writeups.html">here</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of school and cyber, I enjoy rock climbing and building watches. Both challenge me to solve problems, think ahead, and pay close attention to detail. I find 
        these are common tropes in cyber too. Bouldering forces you to think far in advance, where if the planning is bad the execution also fails. Sometimes you
        get trapped in spots you previously thought would help you but actually make your position worse. Finger placement is incredibly important and a slight 
        misplacement will cause you to fall. Watch building really forces attention to detail, with so many tiny moving parts one wrong placement could cost hours.
        I also like to read, when I have the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently seeking a Summer 2026 co-op or internship. Feel free to view my <a href="/resume.html">resume</a> or reach out via the contact info below.
